## Chicago Suburb Generator

Currently, this is just a little Ruby script to output a random suburb to the terminal. A random suburb has the following:
- A name
- A zipcode
- A population number
- A second most common language (after English)
- Two interesting attractions
- A high school with:
  * A name
  * A mascot
  * A championship-winning team (with a year, region, and activity)
- A historical fact about its location
